\chapter{Introduction}
On of the aims of an engineer is to optimize structural properties, weight or the behavior of a given structure. Depending on the field of intrest, certain parameters and properties of the material and part can be adjusted. One of those optimization methods i the Topology Optiization. The main function of this method is to distribute the material in a given area. Depending on the constrains and the functionality of the model part, the optimal structure will be calculated.\\
The code in this work is based on Kratos Multiphysics, an open-source general-purpose Finite Element software.\\
The aim of this work is to extend the existin Topoplogy Optimization Application in Kratos, so that tension restrictions will be included in the calculations.\cite{Goldberg1989}\cite{Le2010}
